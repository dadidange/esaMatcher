# esaMatcher
This library is a go wrapper for [libdivsufsort](https://github.com/y-256/libdivsufsort) and (https://github.com/IlyaGrebnov/libsais). 
It further a type for an ESA to find fast matches between two (or more) strings. 
The wrapping functions are adapted from [esa](https://github.com/evolbioinf/esa). 
The matching algorithms are adapted from [Ohlebusch (2013)](https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/in/theo/m/ohlebusch/book-bioinformatics-algorithms/), [phylonium](https://github.com/evolbioinf/phylonium) and my own masters thesis.
